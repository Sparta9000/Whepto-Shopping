This would open up a web server where you can access the website

The first page would be a login page with a button for signing up, upon logging in you will have a page listing all the items with option to add them to cart if not already added else with an option to update the quantity in the cart. You can also search up items from the top search bar
On the profile page you can view your previous orders and also add or delete added addresses.
The cart page offers to select address, add coupon, remove item or update the quantity of an item.
Upon placing an order, we get an alert asking if we want to simulate the transaction as complete or failed.

For adding items, deleting items or updating the stock, we can go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin page.
